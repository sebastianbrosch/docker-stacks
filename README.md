# :whale: Docker Stacks - Cloud Services
Docker Stacks to provide various cloud services on a server (e.g. VPS) or device (e.g. Raspberry Pi) with Docker Stack.

- Traefik: [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/traefik) - [GitHub](https://github.com/traefik/traefik)
- ownCloud Infinite Scale: [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/owncloud/ocis) - [GitHub](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis)
- Syncthing: [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/syncthing/syncthing) - [GitHub](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing)
- Baikal: [Docker Hub (*unofficial*)](https://hub.docker.com/r/ckulka/baikal) - [GitHub](https://github.com/sabre-io/Baikal)

It is possible to combine these stacks to provide the desired services.

## Install a Docker Stack
You can use the install script `install.sh` to install a Docker Stack. The install script supports the following parameters:

- `-d`, `--debug`: Shows the configuration for the Docker Stack.
- `-h`, `--help`: Shows the help of the install script.
- `-i`, `--install`: Installs the Docker Stack with all prerequisites.
- `-v`, `--version`: Shows the version of the services.

Before installing a Docker Stack, make sure that you have configured all available environment variables using a `.env` file next to the install script (`install.sh`).
